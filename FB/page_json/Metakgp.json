We hope your mid-semester exams went well.\n\nAs the library site was down for most part of mid-semester exams, our site MFQP was also rendered to be down for the first few days, but we found a way out so that we could keep serving papers to everyone in KGP! Now, let's all contribute, and increase the papers MFQP has. Our Paper Collection Drive starts today! We request everyone to submit their mid-semester question papers.\n\nHere's how you can contribute - Click, Upload & Send.\n\n1. Take a picture of your question paper\n2. Write Subject Code in email\n3. Send to metakgp-qp@ <a href=\"http://googlegroups.com\" target=\"_blank\"> googlegroups.com </a> \n\nAnd, do visit  <a href=\"http://metakgp.github.io/mfqp-source/\" target=\"_blank\"> http://metakgp.github.io/... </a>  \n\nNever go to an exam without having had a look at the previous year's paper! Let's all work towards achieving that goal.\n\nThat's all folks! Have a nice week ahead!", "real_time": "08:41PM", "id": "1433721693547904_1734380033482067", "source": "Metakgp", "real_date": "26-09-2016", "created_time": "2016-09-26T15:11:25+0000"}, {"flag": 1, "message": "Want to know how to prepare for CFA Level 1?
